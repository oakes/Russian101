## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to learn Russian? Perhaps you are enamored with their beautiful people, have an interest in their tumultuous history, want to read their literary classics, or plan on committing serious crimes that require you to flee to a country that has no extradition treaty with the United States.

I want to learn Russian too, for several of these reasons. That's why I made this app. It provides a native interface for the Russian audio course created by the Foreign Service Institute. If you don't want to build it yourself, you can find it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sekao.russian101). Enjoy responsibly.

## Other Versions

If you think this app's Java code is ugly as sin, check out these rewrites I did for no particular reason:

* [Kotlin](https://github.com/oakes/Russian101/tree/kotlin)
* [Dart (flutter)](https://github.com/oakes/Russian101/tree/flutter)
* [ClojureScript (react native)](https://github.com/oakes/Russian101/tree/react-native)
